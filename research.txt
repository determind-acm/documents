Linguistic learners understand content best through linguistic skills like reading, writing, listening, and speaking. As a result, this type of learner processes information through the use of language, giving them an excellent memory when it comes to readings and lectures. The process of this learner involves reading information, listening to lectures or audio recordings, and taking further notes on the subject. It may be best to talk about the subject with someone else to ensure a deep understanding of it.
Large focus on notes; Re-reading and re-writing information; Summarizing content (spoken or written); Listing keywords to remember; Use of acronyms;

naturalistic
Naturalistic Learner
Naturalist
Naturalistic learners understand content best by working in or with nature, or experiencing natural situations in the world around them. Many scientists learn this way because observations are at the heart of learning, whether that be relating ideas to concepts in nature, or enjoying rural settings to study and think. There is a large focus on pattern recognition and observation in order to understand content in a way that interests this kind of learner.
Organizing notes on patterns; Simulating real-life situations; Observing and recording data without direct interaction;
 
musical
Musical Learner
Rhythmic, Auditory, Aural
Musical learners understand content best through the inclusion of melodies and rhythms to focus. With this type of learner, music isn't a distraction, but actually aids in the learning process. This background noise could include humming, whistling, toe-tapping, or tapping a pencil on a desk as well. Evidently, these learners think chronologically, like the order of music. By using background noise to their advantage, there is an inherent ability to study nearly anywhere. These attributes result in several key traits.
Strong language skills; Difficulty deciphering graphs; Difficulty deciphering interpersonal cues; Enjoys participating in discussions; Uses mnemonic devices; Listens to music when studying;
 
physical
Physical Learner
